<a id='Project Motivation'></a>
# Project Motivation:
"In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, We will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses".

# File Descriptions:
"This project is part of a [Data analyst Nano degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of Data Analysts work. A strong grasp of statistics will also be necessary for the rest of the Data Nanodegree program".
